# Tic_Tac_Toe
This is most basic project I did when I was a freshman. This project was made with the help of several sites. All I did was to understand and modify and finally boast about it the whole semester.
Tic Tac Toe is a simple game that flexes the basic concepts in programming. For example, a Tic Tac Toe program requires data structures for storing the board and conditional logic for knowing whose turn it is or if someone has won.

Tic Tac Toe's simple rules are very easy to decompose into small, discrete functions that we can put together to create a complete game. This process of decomposition and synthesis, breaking something down and putting it back together, is absolutely essential to programming.

The simple interface Tic Tac Toe requires, a basic 3 x 3 grid, is also easy to port to multiple interfaces.
